This project is to facillitate finding a recipe from the [BBC GoodFood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/) website based upon a selection of ingredients entered by the user.

By logging in the user will also be able to add recipes from [BBC GoodFood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/) website to their selection of chosen recipes from which suggestions will be searched for. (There will also be a default selection of recipes available to all users for generating suggestions from)

I am using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) for my front-end and [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for the back-end. The database will be managed and created using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). I am also using an API documentation library called [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for my API documentation.

The reasons for these choices are as follow:

1. Learning, to a greater or lesser extent these are all new technologies for me and I wish to understand how to use them more efficently.
2. The main method for scraping the information from the [BBC GoodFood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/) website is a python library and as such encourages me to use Python for my back-end.
3. Nuxt.js is similar, although different, to Next.js which I have recently used to create my [personal portfolio site](http://www.bradley-hill.me), as such I am hopeful that the skills learnt on that project will be transferrable.
4. Documentation is extremely important, as such building good habits regarding documenting my project is something I want to pay attention to.
